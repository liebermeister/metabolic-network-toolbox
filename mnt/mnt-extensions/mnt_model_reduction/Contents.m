%Matlab functions for biochemical network reduction 
%
% These functions accompany the article 
% "Biochemical network models simplified by balanced truncation".
% They are based on the Metabolic Network Toolbox
%
% Main functions
%   model_reduction      Compute model reduction for a small example network 
%
%   btsr                 System reduction by balanced truncation. This script
