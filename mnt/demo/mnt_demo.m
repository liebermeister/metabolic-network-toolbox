% MNT_DEMO - Demo for Metabolic Network Toolbox
%
% In this demo, a small metabolic network is 
% built from its stoichiometric matrix, 
% analysed by Metabolic Control Analysis, 
% and a time simulation is run.

% We consider the following simple network
 
% S1             S5
%    \         /
%      S3 - S4
%    /         \
% S2             S6
 
% to illustrate some functions of the Metabolic Network Toolbox.

% We first need to define the network. 
% This is done by the stoichiometric matrix N,
% the reversibility of reactions (as a bit column),
% and the indices of external metabolites
 
N = [ -1  0  0  0  0; ...
       0 -1  0  0  0; ...
       1  1 -1  0  0; ...
       0  0  1 -1 -1; ...
       0  0  0  1  0; ...
       0  0  0  0  1];
 
reversible   = [1 1 1 1 1]';
 
ind_external = [1 2 5 6 ]';

% All information about the network is now stored in the structure
 
network

% The fields 'kinetics' and 'graphics_par' contain information
% about reaction kinetics and the graphical layout (set here by default).
 
% We now define graphics positions of the biochemical network elements 
% (metabolites and reactions) and add this information to the 'network' object

met_x = [0.1,0.1,0.3,0.7,0.9,0.9];

% Now we will analyse the network structure.
% Information about stationary fluxes and conservation relations
% can be obtained from the kernel matrix K and the link matrix L.

% Until here, we only considered the network structure.

% Metabolic control theory has proven theorems that relate the 
% control coefficients to the network structure (described by

% Summation theorems

%  CS * K  = 0
 
% Connectivity theorems
 
%  CJ * epsilon * L = 0
%  CS * epsilon * L = - L
 
% We will now check if our control coefficients satisfy them
 
% In the theorems, we consider only the elasticities and concentration 
% control matrices with respect to internal metabolites
