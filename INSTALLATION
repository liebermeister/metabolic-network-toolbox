INSTALLATION

  1. Unpack the files
  2. Include the subdirectory 'mnt' into your Matlab path
  3. Make sure that the following toolboxes are installed:
      o Matlab utility functions (https://github.com/liebermeister/matlab-utils)
      o SBML Toolbox             (http://sbml.org/Software/SBMLToolbox)
      o SBtab Toolbox            (https://github.com/liebermeister/sbtab-matlab)
      o Tensor Toolbox           (http://www.sandia.gov/~tgkolda/TensorToolbox/index-2.5.html)
      o efmtool                  (http://www.csb.ethz.ch/tools/efmtool)
     For reading and writing cobra files, the matlab cobra toolbox is also required.
     
  4. For a little demo, run 'demo_mnt'


REQUIREMENTS

  The functions were developed and tested with matlab6.

  If CPLEX for matlab is installed in your system, this will speed up some calculations.

  They require the matlab toolboxes mentioned above.

STATE OF THE SOFTWARE.

  The functions are under development and provided 'as is'.
  If you would like to contribute extensions to the toolbox, please let me know.
